# Envision-the-Titatnic-Climax-with-Matplotlib-Numpy-Pandas
Titanic exploration
At the end of the analysis we will be creating three climaxes and come to know the answer of three questions:
•	Was there a possibility if jack lived and rose died?
•	Whether there was really a chance for Jack and Rose to escape and live happily?
•	Did Cal Hockley (Rose’s Fiancé) have a higher chance of survival as he belonged to the upper class or what would make the villain dead?
We are carrying out our analysis using the ‘Matplotlib’, ‘Numpy’,’Pandas’ and ‘Seaborn’ Libraries.
Let us see what each library function is:
Matplotlib is a python library used for visualizing data sets using various plots; it has more than 50 plots to name a few, bar plot, line plot, histogram etc.
Numpy is also a python library which provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays.
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. 
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
